# wk4-vet-practice-ruby-sinatra-project

The brief of this project was to create software for a receptionist to use at a veterinary practice to manage vets & pets. This needed to include the ability to add records and update them as well as be able to asign a pet to a vet. For planning I created wireframes, a class diagram and used a Kanban board(Trello). The app allows both pets & vets to be added to a SQL database via a HTML form with Ruby & then the the records are pulled from the database and displayed in tables via Sinatra where they can be updated & removed RESTfully. Pets can be assigned and reassigned to vets and vets can have multiple pets.
